Pin Configurations:
-------------------

1. Connect RS9116 SPI Header PIN-2 to FRDM-J27 PIN-17 for CS.
2. Connect RS9116 SPI Header PIN-3 to FRDM-J27 PIN-2 for GND.
3. Connect RS9116 SPI Header PIN-4 to FRDM-J27 PIN-1 for VCC.
4. Connect RS9116 SPI Header PIN-5 to FRDM-J27 PIN-18 for CLK.
5. Connect RS9116 SPI Header PIN-7 to FRDM-J27 PIN-19 for MOSI.
6. Connect RS9116 SPI Header PIN-8 to FRDM-J27 PIN-20 for MISO.
7. Connect RS9116 SPI Header PIN-9 to FRDM-J27 PIN-22 for INT.
8. Connect RS9116 SPI Header RST-PS to FRDM-J27 PIN-27 for RESET.


For GPIO based powersave use the following pin configurations:
--------------------------------------------------------------

a) For ULP PowerSave:
---------------------
1.Connect RS9116 UULP_2 to FRDM-J27 PIN-23 (Output Pin form host).
2.Connect RS9116 UULP_3 to FRDM-J27 PIN-28 (Input Pin to host).


Please find steps to use NXP_FRDM_K28 with mcuxpresso project :
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Load firmware in RS9116 module through kermit.
2. Connect SPI header to module (make sure connections are proper) and connect
   power supply to the power port
3. Change/map MCUEXPRESSO's workspace to RSI_WSDK_vX/host/sapis/platforms/NXP_FRDM_K28.
4. Import project from 'RSI_WSDK_vX/host/sapis/platforms/NXP_FRDM_K28' into 'Project Explorer'.
5. Once project is imported, all examples are located under the sapi->examples.
6. Enable the required project in the examples (i.e for example right click on
    wlan->tcp_client->Resource configurations->Exclude from Build->Deslect all) and include the 
   rsi_config.h file path of that particular example only i.e project
   properties->setting->includes and remove any of the unused rsi_config.h paths.
7. Do changes in rsi_config.h (if required) and compile it.
8. Load the application from MCUEXPRESSO and run it.

Note:
=====
1. For Active High firmware image (LOAD_NWP_FW) configure interrupt mode to rising edge (Ex:GPIO_MODE_IT_RISING) in main.c. 
2. For Active Low firmware image (LOAD_DEFAULT_NWP_FW_ACTIVE_LOW) configure interrupt mode to falling edge (Ex:GPIO_MODE_IT_FALLING) in main.c.
