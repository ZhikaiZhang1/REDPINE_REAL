Hi, aquaman has got the router, in order to set it in p2p mode, since the start up script is not in that module, you need to do it manually, 
first, connect module to computer with a microusb, 
then goto artik IDE
create a new command sheel console set the type as serial port and click on new on the next line to setup, 
once you have created connect click reset button on theboard that should reboot the system on the board, 
login should be "root" for both username and password
in the console type in vi /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf,
click "i" on keyboard so that it is in insert mode
copy these lines onto there(ctrl+shift+v):

ap_scan=2
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
update_config=0
device_name=Direct-p2p-mode
device_type=1-0050F204-1
config_methods=virtual_push_button physical_display keypad
p2p_go_intent=7
country=US
p2p_go_max_inactivity=600
p2p_go_ht40=1
disassoc_low_ack=1
p2p_listen_reg_class=81
p2p_listen_channel=36
driver_param=use_p2p_group_interface=1
network={
    mode=3
    disabled=2
    ssid="Logan_conqueror"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    proto=RSN
    pairwise=CCMP
    psk="89706090"
}

this sets up the ssid and password for the router(only need to do once), password is 89706090
then save it by click esc on your keyboard and then ":wq!" (just in case you don't know vi or vim)

then do the following command one by one to set it up in p2p group owner mode
(you can write a startup script so that you do not need to do this every time you turn on the router, I did but forgot how to do it so you need to figure it out by your self):

systemctl stop connman

wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -Dnl80211&

wpa_cli -iwlan0 p2p_group_add persistent=0 freq=2(5875)

ifconfig p2p-wlan0-0 192.168.1.1 up

may need: killall -9 dnsmasq
or: netstat -anlp | grep -w LISTEN, 
sudo ps -f -p 4489
sudo kill 4489

dnsmasq -x /var/run/dnsmasq.pid-p2p-wlan0-0 -i p2p-wlan0-0 -F192.168.1.11,192.168.1.99
now you should have a network called Logan_Conqueror
